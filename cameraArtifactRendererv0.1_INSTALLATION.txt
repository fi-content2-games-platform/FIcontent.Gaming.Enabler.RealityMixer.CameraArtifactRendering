Camera Artifact Rendering v0.1
=============================================================
This tutorial explains how to use the cameraArtifactRenderer Unity package. It was tested with Unity 4.3.1f1 and Vuforia v2.8.

Starting from an empty project:

1. Import a Vuforia AR package, for this tutorial use the imagetargets-2-8-9.unitypackage
2. Open the provided scene Vuforia-ImageTarget. You should have the Vuforia ARCamera as well as at least one ImageTarget object in your scene.
3. Run it to see if it works.
4. Import the cameraArtifactRendererv0.1.unitypackage package.
5. Add the CAR/Prefabs/BackgroundCamera prefab to your scene.
6. Select the ARCamera and add a CARLinearBlur component.
6.1 In the CARLinearBlur select the CARLinearBlur shader as the shader.
6.2 In the CARLinearBlur set your ImageTarget object as the Target.
7. Select the ARCameraRenderTexture as the TargetTexture for the ARCamera
7. Increase the Size of the ARCameraRenderTexture for better quality, use e.g. 1024x1024.

You should now see your virtual objects with added motion blur. 
 - To increase the amount of blur, increase the Blur Multiplier value in the CARLinearBlur component.
 - To make the blur more temporally stable, increase the Stabilizer Strength value in the CARLinearBlur component
